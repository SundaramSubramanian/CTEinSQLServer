# CTE in SQLServer
1) A CTE is a temporary result set, that can be referenced within a 
  SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, that immediately follows the CTE.

2) CTEs allow you to perform multi-level aggregations

3) In SQL, we will use sub-queries to join the records or filter the records from a sub-query. Whenever we refer the same data or join the same set of records using a sub-query, the code maintainability will be difficult. A CTE makes improved readability and maintenance easier.
